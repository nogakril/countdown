# Countdown App (Python + GUI + OpenAI)

A desktop countdown timer with a graphical interface and optional AI-enhanced controls, developed in Python.

---

##  Features

- GUI-based countdown display with dynamic grid visuals (`DotGrid.py`)
- Support for threaded countdown logic (`CounterThread.py`) to keep the UI responsive
- AI-powered interactions or prompts via `OpenAIManager.py` (e.g., voice commands, likely GPT-driven automation)
- Modular architectureâ€”clear separation between logic (`Counter.py`), GUI, and AI components

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (version may vary)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Optionally: OpenAI API key (if `OpenAIManager` is used)
